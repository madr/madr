Hi there 🤘🏿

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on solutions for time tracking using Calendar apps and Slack. Send me an E-mail and ask me about it!

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Phoenix LiveViews. 

💬 Ask me about Progressive Enhancement, Accessibility, React or CSS. 

I blog about web development, heavy metal and geek stuffs on https://madr.se in swedish.
