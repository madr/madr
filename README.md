# Hej och h√•rdrock f√∂r fan!

    // That is "Hi! ü§ò" in swedish

I'm a web developer who currently works for [Iteam](https://iteam.se). My passion is to solve problems with solutions that are accessible, inclusive and pleasant to use. I am always willing to learn new things, but I prefer to keep things simple and straight-forward without unnecessary clutter: I [embrace boring tech](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology).

I wrote **JavaScript** before it was cool and have used **Python** with joy for a decade. Currently, I learn **Rust** and **Phoenix LiveView**. I have also recently rediscovered the **Node.js** fullstack web development community, and try to master **Elixir**.

## Current brain teasers

- What makes a good time tracking system that does not suck?
- I miss the old Instapaper so much, a minimalistic selfhosted link reading list would be so nice to have again!
- I love Metalsmith, the pluggable static site generator, but not the Node.js leverage: what if it existed a port?
- HTML-over-websockets is so cool, but will it really challenge the SPA paradigm?
- When is a PWA the correct way to go?
- Micro-frontend, extreme or just full monty?
