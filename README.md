# Hej och h√•rdrock f√∂r fan!

    // That is "Hi! ü§ò" in swedish

I make web sites and currently works for [Stratsys](https://stratsys.se) as a Senior Frontend Architect. My passion is to solve problems with solutions that are accessible, inclusive and pleasant to use. I am always willing to learn new things, but I prefer to keep things simple and straight-forward without unnecessary clutter: I [embrace boring tech](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology).

I wrote **JavaScript** before it was cool and have used **Python** with joy for a decade. Currently, I learn **Rust** and **Phoenix LiveView**. I also try to master **Elixir**.

## Current brain teasers

- What makes a good time tracking system that does not suck?
- I miss the old Instapaper so much, a minimalistic selfhosted link reading list would be so nice to have again!
- I love Metalsmith, the pluggable static site generator, but not the Node.js leverage: what if it existed a port?
- HTML-over-websockets is so cool, but will it really challenge the SPA paradigm?
- SSR React/Vue/Svelte, when to use instead of HTML-over-websockets? 
- When is a PWA the correct way to go?
- Micro-frontend, extreme or just full monty?
